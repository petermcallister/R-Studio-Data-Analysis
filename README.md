# Overview

In this project, I explore the different questions on gun deaths including: suicides by race, gun deaths based on education per season, and gun deaths based on sex also per season. The results were as expected, but more intensely different than I thought.

The dataset I chose was one found in github. I liked it because the data was pretty tidy and clean, so I didn't have to do much wrangling. It gives you a lot of information including: year, month, intent, age, sex, etc. The link to the dataset is here:

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
My purpose in writing this code was to show the massive difference in specific social groups so that we can better solve a huge issue going on in the world. I feel we tend to generalize solutions to problems, but, in reality, we should dive deeper to solve the root problem(s).

# Data Analysis Results

## Question 1:
Which race has the most suicides and by how much?

## Answer 1:
As you can tell, by a significant margin, white people have the highest suicide rate out of any other race.

## Question 2:
Does education level play a role in gun deaths?

## Answer 2:
The data shows all the gun deaths based on education throughout the 4 seasons. As you can see, those in High School are extraordinarily higher than any other education. Also, note that those who graduate college are significantly less likely to be part of a gun death.

## Question 3:
Does someone's sex play a factor in gun deaths and by how much?

## Answer 3:

Males heavily outnumber females in this data. Female gun deaths are around 1/4 that of males. Also, it is interesting that winter has the least amount of gun deaths out of all seasons.

# Future Work

* Be better at graphing themes/ look of graphs.
* The dataset I used has a lot of information. I could add more graphs to show that.
* Use more modern colors in the graphs to make them more visually appealing.
