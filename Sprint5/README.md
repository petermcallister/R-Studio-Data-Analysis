# Overview

In this project, I display what I have learned in the past 2 weeks about how to display maps within R. Although this map doesn't do much in terms of visualizing data, it does show my knowledge in using the variuos functions in the sf library.

The dataset I chose was one found in the byu stats github. I liked it because the data was pretty tidy and clean, so I didn't have to do much wrangling. It gives you a lot of information including: state, information of landmarks (dams, water, wells), etc. The links to the datasets I used are here:
"https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/shp.zip"
"https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/water.zip"
"https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/Idaho_Dams.zip"
"https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/Wells.zip"

My purpose in writing this code was to show my learning with a new library within R (sf). Like previously mentioned, it doesn't really tell much from looking at the graph, oit simply was to display my knowledge in R using a specific set of functions within a very useful library.

# Future Work

* Have it show some kind of statistic about Idaho.
* The dataset I used has a lot of information. I could add more graphs to show that by filtering columns differently.
* Use more landmarks to display on the graphic.
